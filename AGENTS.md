## Guide

1. Pls read [README.md](README.md) WHEN YOU SEE THIS LINE.
2. For full-stack changes, please follow this workflow: Backend changes -> generate_frontend -> Frontend changes.

## Compatibility

The project is in the development stage, and modifications to APIs, related functions, and interfaces do not need to consider compatibility.
However, the reference must be checked to ensure that the reference does not make mistakes.

## Notes

1. Before modifying a file, ensure that it is up to date, if you cannot ensure, read it again. The file may be manually modified by the user.
1. Never create an alembic version file manually, use `alembic revision` instead, unless user specifies.
