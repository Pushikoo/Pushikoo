# AGENTS.md

## Guide

For development, see [README.md](README.md).
If there are API modification and build-related operations, the above content will be very important.

## Compatibility

The project is in the development stage, and modifications to APIs, related functions, and interfaces do not need to consider compatibility.
However, the reference must be modified to ensure that the reference does not make mistakes.

## Notes

1. Before modifying a code file, read it again to ensure that it is up to date. The file may be manually modified by the user.
1. Never create an alembic version file manually, use `alembic revision` instead, unless user specifies.
